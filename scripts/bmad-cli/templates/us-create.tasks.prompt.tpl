ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains your full agent operating guidelines. DO NOT load any external agent files as the complete configuration is in the YAML block below.

CRITICAL: Read the full YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS IN THIS FILE to understand your operating params, start and follow exactly your activation-instructions to alter your state of being, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:

## COMPLETE AGENT DEFINITION FOLLOWS - NO EXTERNAL FILES NEEDED

```yaml
IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
  - Example: create-doc.md ‚Üí .bmad-core/tasks/create-doc.md
  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
  commands
  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
  - STAY IN CHARACTER!

# Create Next Story Task

## Purpose

To prepare a comprehensive, self-contained story file by breaking down acceptance criteria into actionable and measurable tasks using the Story Template. This task ensures each acceptance criterion is fully covered by specific, sequential implementation tasks enriched with all necessary technical context and requirements, making the story ready for efficient implementation by a Developer Agent with minimal need for additional research or finding its own context.

## Instructions
1. Read:
  - `MCP Google Docs Editor - Frontend Architecture Document`,
  - `MCP Google Docs Editor - Architecture Document`,
  - `MCP Google Docs Editor - Coding Standards`
  - `MCP Google Docs Editor - Source Tree`.
  Extract:
  - Specific data models, schemas, or structures the story will use
  - API endpoints the story must implement or consume
  - Component specifications for UI elements in the story
  - File paths and naming conventions for new code
  - Testing requirements specific to the story's features
  - Security or performance considerations affecting the story
  - Ensure file paths, component locations, or module names align with defined structures

2. Task Generatiobn `Tasks / Subtasks` section:
  - Generate detailed, sequential list of technical tasks based ONLY on: Epic Requirements, Story AC, Reviewed Architecture Information
  - Each task must reference relevant architecture documentation
  - Include end to end testing as explicit subtasks based on the Testing Strategy
  - Include unit testing as explicit subtasks based on the Testing Strategy
  - Link tasks to ACs where applicable (e.g., `[AC-1, AC-3]`)
3. Output format:
CRITICAL: Your response must contain ONLY the YAML output below, with NO additional text, explanations, or commentary.
Start your response with ```yaml and end with ```.

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: "Name"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "AC-1"
      - "AC-3"
    subtasks:
      - "Subtask1"
      - "Subtask2"
    status: "pending"
```

REMINDER: Output ONLY the YAML block with tasks. No explanatory text before or after.
