# 0. Load Core Configuration and Check Workflow

- Load `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` from the project root
- If the file does not exist, HALT and inform the user: "core-config.yaml not found. This file is required for story creation. You can either: 1) Copy it from GITHUB bmad-core/core-config.yaml and configure it for your project OR 2) Run the BMad installer against your project to upgrade and add the file automatically. Please add and configure core-config.yaml before proceeding."
- Extract key configurations: `devStoryLocation`, `prd.*`, `architecture.*`, `workflow.*`
