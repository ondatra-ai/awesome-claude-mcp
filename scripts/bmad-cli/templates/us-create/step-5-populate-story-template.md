# 5. Populate Story Template with Full Context

- Create new story file: `{devStoryLocation}/{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` using Story Template
- Fill in basic story information: Title, Status (Draft), Story statement, Acceptance Criteria from Epic
- **`Dev Notes` section (CRITICAL):**
  - CRITICAL: This section MUST contain ONLY information extracted from architecture documents. NEVER invent or assume technical details.
  - Include ALL relevant technical details from Steps 2-3, organized by category:
    - **Previous Story Insights**: Key learnings from previous story
    - **Data Models**: Specific schemas, validation rules, relationships [with source references]
    - **API Specifications**: Endpoint details, request/response formats, auth requirements [with source references]
    - **Component Specifications**: UI component details, props, state management [with source references]
    - **File Locations**: Exact paths where new code should be created based on project structure
    - **Testing Requirements**: Specific test cases or strategies from testing-strategy.md
    - **Technical Constraints**: Version requirements, performance considerations, security rules
  - Every technical detail MUST include its source reference: `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`
  - If information for a category is not found in the architecture docs, explicitly state: "No specific guidance found in architecture docs"
- **`Tasks / Subtasks` section:**
  - Generate detailed, sequential list of technical tasks based ONLY on: Epic Requirements, Story AC, Reviewed Architecture Information
  - Each task must reference relevant architecture documentation
  - Include unit testing as explicit subtasks based on the Testing Strategy
  - Link tasks to ACs where applicable (e.g., `Task 1 (AC: 1, 3)`)
- Add notes on project structure alignment or discrepancies found in Step 4
