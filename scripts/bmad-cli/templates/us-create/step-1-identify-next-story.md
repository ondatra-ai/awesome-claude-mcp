# 1. Identify Next Story for Preparation

## 1.1 Locate Epic Files and Review Existing Stories

- Based on `prdSharded` from config, locate epic files (sharded location/pattern or monolithic PRD sections)
- If `devStoryLocation` has story files, load the highest `{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` file
- **If highest story exists:**
  - Verify status is 'Done'. If not, alert user: "ALERT: Found incomplete story! File: {lastEpicNum}.{lastStoryNum}.story.md Status: [current status] You should fix this story first, but would you like to accept risk & override to create the next story in draft?"
  - If proceeding, select next sequential story in the current epic
  - If epic is complete, prompt user: "Epic {epicNum} Complete: All stories in Epic {epicNum} have been completed. Would you like to: 1) Begin Epic {epicNum + 1} with story 1 2) Select a specific story to work on 3) Cancel story creation"
  - **CRITICAL**: NEVER automatically skip to another epic. User MUST explicitly instruct which story to create.
- **If no story files exist:** The next story is ALWAYS 1.1 (first story of first epic)
- Announce the identified story to the user: "Identified next story for preparation: {epicNum}.{storyNum} - {Story Title}"
