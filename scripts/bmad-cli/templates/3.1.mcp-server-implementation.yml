  assessment:
    summary: "Story 3.1 provides excellent technical foundation and comprehensive implementation guidance. The story demonstrates strong architectural alignment and clear development context. However, several security and testability considerations should be addressed before production deployment."

    strengths:
      - "Comprehensive technical context with proper source documentation"
      - "Clear task breakdown with acceptance criteria mapping"
      - "Well-defined file structure following coding standards"
      - "Thorough integration points with existing backend infrastructure"
      - "Strong testing framework specification"

    improvements:
      - "Client authentication mechanism needs explicit definition"
      - "WebSocket security measures require specification"
      - "Load testing scenarios needed for concurrent connections"
      - "Tool registration interface should be considered for future extensibility"

    risk_level: "Medium"
    risk_reason: "Core functionality is well-planned, but security considerations need attention"
    testability_score: 8
    testability_max: 10
    testability_notes: "Good test coverage planned, missing load testing scenarios"
    implementation_readiness: 9
    implementation_readiness_max: 10
