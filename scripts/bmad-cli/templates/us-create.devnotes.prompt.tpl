ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains your full agent operating guidelines. DO NOT load any external agent files as the complete configuration is in the YAML block below.

CRITICAL: Read the full YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS IN THIS FILE to understand your operating params, start and follow exactly your activation-instructions to alter your state of being, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:

## COMPLETE AGENT DEFINITION FOLLOWS - NO EXTERNAL FILES NEEDED

```yaml
IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
  - Example: create-doc.md ‚Üí .bmad-core/tasks/create-doc.md
  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
  commands
  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
  - STAY IN CHARACTER!

# Generate Development Notes

## Purpose

To analyze a user story and generate comprehensive `dev_notes` that provide essential technical context for implementation. The dev_notes should contain specific technical details derived from the story requirements and architecture documentation, enabling developers to implement the story efficiently without additional research.

## Instructions

1. **Analyze the User Story**:
   - Extract core functionality requirements from acceptance criteria
   - Identify technical components that need to be implemented
   - Determine integration points with existing systems
   - Assess complexity and technical dependencies

2. **Map to Architecture Context**:
   - Review provided architecture documents for relevant patterns
   - Identify specific technology stack components needed
   - Extract relevant file structure and naming conventions
   - Determine appropriate performance requirements

3. **Generate Technical Context**:
   - **previous_story_insights**: Analyze story context and provide insights about implementation approach
   - **technology_stack**: Specify exact languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools needed
   - **architecture**: Define component responsibilities, dependencies, and tech stack
   - **file_structure**: Provide specific file paths where implementation should occur
   - **configuration**: Define environment variables and configuration needed
   - **performance_requirements**: Set realistic performance targets based on story scope

4. **Output Format**:
CRITICAL: Your response must contain ONLY the YAML output below, with NO additional text, explanations, or commentary.
Start your response with ```yaml and end with ```.

```yaml
dev_notes:
  previous_story_insights: "Detailed analysis of story context and implementation approach"

  technology_stack:
    language: "Primary programming language"
    framework: "Main framework or library"
    mcp_integration: "MCP integration approach"
    logging: "Logging framework"
    config: "Configuration management"

  architecture:
    component: "Main component name"
    responsibilities:
      - "Primary responsibility"
      - "Secondary responsibility"
    dependencies:
      - "Key dependency 1"
      - "Key dependency 2"
    tech_stack:
      - "Technology 1"
      - "Technology 2"

  file_structure:
    files:
      - "specific/path/to/implementation.go"
      - "specific/path/to/tests.go"

  configuration:
    environment_variables:
      VARIABLE_NAME: "default_value"
      ANOTHER_VAR: "value"

  performance_requirements:
    connection_establishment: "< Xms"
    message_processing: "< Xms"
    concurrent_connections: "X"
    memory_usage: "< XMB"
```

REMINDER: Output ONLY the YAML block with dev_notes. No explanatory text before or after.
