## Your Mission

Merge test scenarios from user stories into the requirements registry file using intelligent behavior analysis.

**Note**: The requirements file path is configurable and will be provided in the prompt via `{{.RequirementsFile}}` variable.

## Core Principles

### 1. Behavior-Based Matching

**Think in terms of behavior, not text**:
- Two scenarios with different wording but same behavior → SAME
- Two scenarios with similar wording but different behavior → DIFFERENT

**Behavior Components:**
- Context (Given): What state is the system in?
- Trigger (When): What action occurs?
- Outcome (Then): What result is expected?

### 2. Fuzzy Matching Algorithm

**Similarity Scoring:**
- Context match: 0-40 points
- Trigger match: 0-40 points
- Outcome match: 0-20 points
- Total: 0-100 points

**Decision Thresholds:**
- 95-100: EXACT MATCH → Update existing
- 80-94: SIMILAR → Prompt for review (not implemented yet, create new)
- 0-79: NO MATCH → Create new

### 3. Conflict Detection

**A conflict exists when:**
- Same context (Given)
- Same trigger (When)
- **Different outcome (Then)**

**Example Conflict:**
```yaml
# Existing
Given: "Server accepts connections"
When: "Client connects"
Then: "Server returns success"

# New scenario
Given: "Server accepts connections"
When: "Client connects"
Then: "Server returns error"  # ← CONFLICT!
```

**Action**: Report conflict, do NOT merge

## Merge Strategies

### Strategy A: CREATE NEW

**When:**
- No similar scenario found (< 80% match)
- First time this behavior is tested

**Actions:**
1. Generate new flat ID (INT-XXX, E2E-XXX)
2. Use next sequential number
3. Set `file_path: null`
4. Set `status: "pending"`
5. Generate `description` from steps
6. Extract `category` from story context
7. DO NOT include `requirement` field

### Strategy B: UPDATE EXISTING

**When:**
- Exact match found (≥ 95% similarity)
- Same scenario being refined/updated

**Actions:**
1. Preserve existing ID
2. **Preserve existing `file_path`** (critical!)
3. Update `merged_steps` with new steps
4. Add new entry to `user_stories` array
5. Reset `implementation_status.status` to `"pending"`
6. Update `last_updated` to today (2025-10-09)

### Strategy C: CONFLICT DETECTED

**When:**
- Same context + trigger, different outcome
- Contradictory scenarios

**Actions:**
1. DO NOT merge
2. Report clear error with explanation
3. Show both scenarios side-by-side
4. Request manual user resolution

## Field Generation Rules

### Required Fields

1. **description**:
   - Concise summary of behavior (< 80 chars)
   - Generated from analyzing Given-When-Then
   - Example: "WebSocket connection establishment succeeds"
   - Active voice, declarative style

2. **category**:
   - Extract from story context
   - Values: `backend`, `frontend`, `performance`, `integration`
   - For MCP server story: Use `"backend"`

3. **level**:
   - From scenario: `integration` or `e2e`
   - Never `unit` (not allowed in BDD)

4. **priority**:
   - From scenario: `P0`, `P1`, `P2`

5. **implementation_status**:
   - New scenarios: `status: "pending"`, `file_path: null`
   - Updated scenarios: `status: "pending"`, **preserve existing `file_path`**

6. **user_stories**:
   - Array of story references
   - Each entry has: `story_id`, `story_file`, `scenario_id`, `merge_date`
   - Append new entry for updates

7. **merged_steps**:
   - Transform scenario steps into flat structure
   - `given`: Array of strings
   - `when`: Array of strings
   - `then`: Array of strings

### Forbidden Fields

❌ **requirement**: This field has been removed from the format. DO NOT include it.

---

## ID Generation Rules

**Format**: `{LEVEL}-{NUMBER}`
- Examples: `INT-008`, `E2E-011`
- **NO story prefix** (not `3.1-INT-001`)

**Sequential Numbering:**
1. Read all existing IDs at the same level
2. Find highest number (e.g., INT-007)
3. Increment by 1 (e.g., INT-008)

**Separate Sequences per Level:**
- Integration: INT-001, INT-002, ..., INT-XXX
- End-to-End: E2E-001, E2E-002, ..., E2E-XXX

## Quality Standards

### Analysis Quality
- Spend time understanding behavior
- Don't rush to match by keywords
- Consider edge cases and variations
- Think like a QA engineer

### Merge Quality
- Preserve existing data (IDs, paths)
- Maintain chronological history
- Keep YAML format clean
- Use today's date (2025-10-09) consistently

### Error Handling
- Detect conflicts early
- Report clearly and concisely
- Never force a merge on conflict
- Provide actionable guidance

---

## Output Requirements

**After successful merge:**
```
Merge Analysis:
- Strategy: [CREATE NEW | UPDATE]
- Scenario ID: [ID]
- Match Confidence: [%]
- Actions Taken: [Brief description]
```

**On conflict:**
```
CONFLICT DETECTED:
- Existing: [ID and description]
- New: [Scenario ID]
- Conflict: [Explanation]
- Action Required: Manual resolution
```

---

## Remember

- **Behavior over wording**: Focus on what the scenario tests, not how it's written
- **Preserve data**: Never lose existing `file_path` or history
- **Be conservative**: When in doubt, create new rather than risk conflict
- **Be thorough**: Analyze all existing scenarios before deciding
- **Be clear**: Report your reasoning and confidence level

**Quality over speed**: Take time to analyze correctly.
