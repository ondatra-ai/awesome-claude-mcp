# Discovery workshop

## What is a discovery workshop?

A discovery workshop is a conversation where technical and business people collaborate to explore, discover and agree as much as they can about the desired behaviour for a [User Story](/docs/terms/user-story/).

## How do you conduct a discovery workshop?

There are several discovery workshop models, these are just a few:

[**Example Mapping**](/docs/bdd/example-mapping/)

Uses a pack of index cards in four different colours to map rules (a summary of constraints/acceptance criteria the team has agreed upon) to examples (illustrations/cases of the acceptance criteria)

[**OOPSI Mapping (Outcomes, Outputs, Processes, Scenarios, Inputs)**](https://jennyjmar.com/2016/04/16/bdd-discovery-and-oopsi/)

Similar to Example Mapping, uses Post-it Notes of different colours to map shared processes/relationships between outputs and scenarios.

[**Feature Mapping**](https://johnfergusonsmart.com/feature-mapping-a-simpler-path-from-stories-to-executable-acceptance-criteria/)

Also uses Post-it Notes of different colours.  The team picks a story from the backlog, identifies the actors involved, breaks the story down into tasks, and maps those tasks to specific examples.

## When should you hold a discovery workshop?

As late as possible before development on a new User Story begins, in order to prevent details from being lost. Conducting a discovery workshop as late as possible also gives the team enough leg room to shift their plans should new details surface.

## Who should attend?

A good rule-of-thumb is 3-6 people, but at a bare minimum your [Three Amigos](/docs/bdd/who-does-what/#the-three-amigos/) should be present: a product owner, a developer, and a tester.  Your product owner will identify the problem the team should be trying to solve, your developer will address how to build a solution around said problem, and your tester will address any edge cases that could arise.

## How long does a discovery workshop take?

A discovery workshop should ideally only last about 25-30 minutes
