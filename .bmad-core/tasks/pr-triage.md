# pr-triage

Stage and process PR review conversations deterministically using local files.

## Purpose

Provide a predictable, file‑based workflow to read all PR conversations once, track processed items, and surface the next conversation for analysis.

## Process

1) Read conversations to `tmp/CONV.json`.
   - Run: `go run scripts/list-pr-conversations/main.go tmp/CONV.json [PR_NUMBER]`
   - MUST write the full conversations JSON array to `tmp/CONV.json`.
   - MUST NOT print JSON to standard output.

2) Create `tmp/CONV_ID.txt`.
   - Initialize file if missing: empty by default.
   - Purpose: store processed conversation IDs (one per line).

3) Identify the next conversation to process.
   - Write a Go script that reads `tmp/CONV.json` and `tmp/CONV_ID.txt`, finds the first conversation ID present in JSON that is not listed in `tmp/CONV_ID.txt`, and writes the complete conversation object to `tmp/CONV_CURRENT.json`.
   - If none remain, write exactly `{ "id": "No More Converations" }` to `tmp/CONV_CURRENT.json`.

4) Read `tmp/CONV_CURRENT.json`.
   - If it contains `{ "id": "No More Converations" }`, stop.
   - Otherwise, proceed with heuristic analysis for that conversation.

## Artifcts

- `scripts/list-pr-conversations/main.go`
  - Reads review threads for the current PR (or a provided PR number) and writes the full conversations JSON array to a file.
  - Usage: `go run scripts/list-pr-conversations/main.go tmp/CONV.json [PR_NUMBER]`
  - Guarantees: writes to `tmp/CONV.json` (or specified path), produces no JSON on stdout.

- `tmp/CONV.json`
  - Cached conversations JSON (array of conversation objects) used as the single source of truth for the triage run.

- `tmp/CONV_ID.txt`
  - Line‑separated list of processed conversation IDs.
  - Empty by default; updated after each conversation is processed.

- Next selection script (to be written)
  - Reads `tmp/CONV.json` and `tmp/CONV_ID.txt`.
  - Writes the first unprocessed conversation object to `tmp/CONV_CURRENT.json`.
  - If none remain, writes exactly `{ "id": "No More Converations" }` to `tmp/CONV_CURRENT.json`.
  - Suggested path/name: `scripts/pr-triage/next.go` (or equivalent).

- `tmp/CONV_CURRENT.json`
  - The single conversation object to analyze next, or the sentinel `{ "id": "No More Converations" }` when finished.
