# pr-triage

Stage and process PR review conversations deterministically using local files.

## Purpose

Provide a predictable, file‑based workflow to read all PR conversations once, track processed items, and surface the next conversation for analysis.

## Artifcts

- `scripts/list-pr-conversations/main.go`
  - Reads review threads for the current PR (or a provided PR number) and writes the full conversations JSON array to a file.
  - Usage: `go run scripts/list-pr-conversations/main.go tmp/CONV.json [PR_NUMBER]`
  - Guarantees: writes to `tmp/CONV.json` (or specified path), produces no JSON on stdout.

- `tmp/CONV.json`
  - Cached conversations JSON (array of conversation objects) used as the single source of truth for the triage run.

- `tmp/CONV_ID.txt`
  - Line‑separated list of processed conversation IDs.
  - Empty by default; updated after each conversation is processed.

- Next selection script (to be written)
  - Reads `tmp/CONV.json` and `tmp/CONV_ID.txt`.
  - Writes the first unprocessed conversation object to `tmp/CONV_CURRENT.json`.
  - If none remain, writes exactly `{ "id": "No More Converations" }` to `tmp/CONV_CURRENT.json`.
  - Suggested path/name: `scripts/pr-triage/next.go` (or equivalent).

- `tmp/CONV_CURRENT.json`
  - The single conversation object to analyze next, or the sentinel `{ "id": "No More Converations" }` when finished.

## Process

1) Read conversations to `tmp/CONV.json`.
   - Run: `go run scripts/list-pr-conversations/main.go tmp/CONV.json [PR_NUMBER]`
   - MUST write the full conversations JSON array to `tmp/CONV.json`.
   - MUST NOT print JSON to standard output.

2) Create `tmp/CONV_ID.txt`.
   - Initialize file if missing: empty by default.
   - Cleat it if it exists.
   - Purpose: store processed conversation IDs (one per line).

3) Identify the next conversation to process.
   - Run: `go run scripts/pr-triage/next-pr-conversation.go tmp/CONV.json tmp/CONV_ID.txt tmp/CONV_CURRENT.json`

4) Read `tmp/CONV_CURRENT.json`.
   - If it contains `{ "id": "No More Converations" }`, stop.
   - Otherwise, proceed with heuristic analysis for that conversation.
5) Goto item 3.

## Heuristic analysis

1) Perform Heuristic checklist
   - Use `.bmad-core/checklists/triage-heuristic-checklist.md` against the single conversation in `tmp/CONV_CURRENT.json`.
   - Ensure each item is evaluated; record any conflicts or notes.
   - Out Perform Heuristic checklist results

2) Determine the best option to proceed
   - Choose one: implement now, request changes/clarification, defer and create an issue, or escalate (architect/PO/QA).
   - Base the choice on alignment, scope fit, and value/effort.

3) Determine the risk score (1–10)
   - 1–3: low (cosmetic, doc, trivial refactor, isolated change)
   - 4–6: medium (localized behavior, limited blast radius)
   - 7–10: high (architecture/security/performance implications or wide impact)
   - Record the numeric score and rationale.

4) If risk < 5, implement without human-in-the-loop
   - Conditions: strictly within PR scope, passes checklist alignment, and all tests pass locally.
   - DO NOT COMMIT CHANGES
   - Apply the change, run tests, update the conversation with a concise summary of what changed and why.
   - Otherwise (risk ≥ 5), output the recommendation and wait for human approval using "bmad-core/templates/pr-triage-output-tmpl.yaml".
