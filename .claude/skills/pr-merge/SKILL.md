description: Merge the current branch's PR using squash merge, delete the remote branch, switch to main, pull latest, and clean up the local branch. Use this skill whenever the user wants to merge a PR, finish a branch, land changes, or says things like "merge this", "land it", "ship it", "merge the PR", or "we're done with this branch".

# PR Merge

Merge the current branch's pull request and clean up afterwards. This is a squash merge workflow that keeps the main branch history clean.

## Steps

1. Get the current branch name so you can clean it up later
2. Run `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` to squash-merge and delete the remote branch
3. Detect whether the main branch is called `main` or `master`
4. Check out the main branch and pull latest changes
5. Delete the local feature branch if it still exists (`gh pr merge --delete-branch` may have already removed it)

## Implementation

Run these commands in sequence. Stop and report if any step fails — don't continue blindly if the merge itself didn't succeed.

```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch

MAIN_BRANCH="main"
if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/master; then
    MAIN_BRANCH="master"
fi

git checkout $MAIN_BRANCH
git pull origin $MAIN_BRANCH || exit 1

if git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/heads/$CURRENT_BRANCH"; then
    git branch -D "$CURRENT_BRANCH"
fi
```

## Requirements

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated
- The current branch must have an open pull request
