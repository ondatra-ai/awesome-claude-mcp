# Story 1.1: Minimal Frontend-Backend Integration Setup

**Status:** Ready for Review
**Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Infrastructure
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 8 hours

## Story

**As a** Developer/Maintainer
**I want** to create a minimal Next.js frontend connected to a Go backend
**So that** I have a working full-stack foundation to build upon

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Monorepo structure with services/ directory created
- [x] Go backend service with `/version` endpoint returning "1.0.0"
- [x] Next.js 14 single-page frontend application
- [x] Frontend homepage displays backend version "1.0.0" at the bottom
- [x] Docker and docker-compose configuration for local development
- [x] Playwright E2E testing framework configured
- [x] Go modules initialized for backend service
- [x] Next.js project initialized with TypeScript
- [x] Dockerfiles created for both services
- [x] Basic project structure follows architecture document
- [x] Health check endpoints for both services
- [x] README.md with setup and run instructions

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Create Monorepo Structure
- [x] Create services/ directory
- [x] Create services/frontend/ directory
- [x] Create services/backend/ directory
- [x] Update .gitignore for monorepo structure

### Task 2: Initialize Go Backend Service
- [x] Initialize Go module in services/backend/
- [x] Create basic Fiber server setup
- [x] Implement /version endpoint returning "1.0.0"
- [x] Implement /health endpoint
- [x] Create basic project structure (cmd/, internal/, pkg/)
- [x] Add structured logging with zerolog
- [x] Create Dockerfile for backend service

### Task 3: Initialize Next.js Frontend Service
- [x] Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS
- [x] Create homepage component
- [x] Add API client to fetch backend version
- [x] Display backend version at bottom of homepage
- [x] Create /health API route
- [x] Create Dockerfile for frontend service

### Task 4: Docker and Development Setup
- [x] Create docker-compose.yml for local development
- [x] Configure environment variables
- [x] Test docker-compose startup
- [x] Create development scripts

### Task 5: Testing Framework Setup
- [x] Configure Playwright for E2E testing
- [x] Create basic E2E test for homepage
- [x] Configure Jest for frontend unit tests
- [x] Configure testify for Go unit tests
- [x] Create test for /version endpoint

### Task 6: Documentation and Final Setup
- [x] Create comprehensive README.md
- [x] Document setup and run instructions
- [x] Test full development workflow
- [x] Validate all acceptance criteria

## Dev Notes

- Follow architecture document structure from docs/architecture/source-tree.md
- Use Go 1.21.5 and Fiber framework as specified in tech stack
- Use Next.js 14 with App Router
- All services should be containerized from the start
- Include health checks for monitoring readiness

## Testing

**Note:** Test scenarios have been moved to comprehensive QA documentation:
- **Frontend Tests:** See [Frontend QA Scenarios](../qa/frontend-scenarios.md)
- **Backend Tests:** See [Backend QA Scenarios](../qa/backend-scenarios.md)
- **MCP Tests:** See [MCP QA Scenarios](../qa/mcp-scenarios.md) (future implementation)

### Test Summary for Story 1.1
- ✅ **Backend Unit Tests:** `/version` and `/health` endpoints (Go testify)
- ✅ **Frontend Unit Tests:** VersionDisplay component (Jest + React Testing Library)
- ✅ **E2E Integration Tests:** Frontend-backend communication (Playwright)
- ✅ **API Integration Tests:** Backend endpoints, CORS, error handling (Playwright)

### Current Test Coverage
- **Frontend:** 2 E2E tests + 4 unit tests = 6 total tests ✅
- **Backend:** 5 API integration tests + unit tests = 6+ total tests ✅
- **Full Stack:** 7 unified E2E tests covering both services ✅
