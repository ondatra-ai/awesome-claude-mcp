  previous_story_insights: Story 3.1 requires implementing a complete MCP server that enables Claude to communicate with Google Docs via the Model Context Protocol. This is a foundational service that will serve as the bridge between Claude AI and Google Docs operations. The implementation needs to support all six document operations (replace_all, append, prepend, replace_match, insert_before, insert_after) with proper WebSocket communication, authentication, and error handling. The service must follow the existing monorepo structure under services/mcp-service and integrate with the existing backend service for authentication and user management.

  assessment:
    summary: "Well-structured story with comprehensive acceptance criteria and detailed task breakdown. Strong technical foundation with proper technology choices. Minor concerns around integration complexity and error handling depth."

    strengths:
      - "Clear acceptance criteria covering all MCP protocol requirements"
      - "Comprehensive task breakdown with 12 detailed implementation phases"
      - "Strong technology stack selection with Mark3Labs MCP-Go library"
      - "Proper authentication and concurrent connection handling planned"
      - "Well-defined integration with existing backend services"
      - "Comprehensive testing strategy including unit, integration, and e2e tests"
      - "Detailed file structure and architecture documentation"
      - "Performance requirements clearly specified"

    improvements:
      - "Add specific error scenarios and recovery procedures to acceptance criteria"
      - "Include MCP protocol version compatibility requirements"
      - "Define specific metrics for connection management success criteria"
      - "Add security validation requirements for tool parameter inputs"
      - "Specify load testing thresholds for concurrent connection support"
      - "Include rollback procedures for deployment tasks"

    risk_level: "Medium"
    risk_reason: "Complex integration between MCP protocol, WebSocket management, Google Docs API, and authentication services. Multiple external dependencies (Mark3Labs library, Google APIs) create potential failure points. Concurrent connection handling adds complexity."
    testability_score: 8
