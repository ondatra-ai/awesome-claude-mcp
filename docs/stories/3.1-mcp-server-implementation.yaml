      insights:
          - MCP server is a critical backend component providing WebSocket communication with Claude AI
          - High performance requirements for real-time communication with multiple clients
          - Must implement full MCP protocol spec with command pattern for operations
          - No retry attempts per fail-fast philosophy in coding standards

  assessment:
    summary: "Story demonstrates high maturity with thorough technical specification, clear acceptance criteria, and well-defined tasks. Development notes provide comprehensive architectural context and performance requirements. Critical backend component with complex concurrent handling needs additional focus on error scenarios and security testing."

    strengths:
      - "Detailed task breakdown with clear mapping to acceptance criteria"
      - "Comprehensive technical documentation with architecture and configuration details"
      - "Well-defined performance requirements with specific metrics"
      - "Strong test coverage plan including unit, integration and load testing"
      - "Clear file structure and component responsibilities defined"

    improvements:
      - "Define specific error scenarios and failure modes for integration testing"
      - "Add security testing requirements including WebSocket endpoint validation"
      - "Specify monitoring alerts and thresholds for production readiness"
      - "Include circuit breaker and fallback configuration details"
      - "Define specific performance test acceptance criteria with thresholds"

    risk_level: "Medium"
    risk_reason: "Critical backend component with complex concurrent connection handling and real-time communication requirements. Dependency on Mark3Labs MCP-Go library and strict performance requirements increase technical risk."
    testability_score: 8
    testability_max: 10
    testability_notes: "High testability with clear test points, validation criteria and performance metrics. Integration test approach well-defined. Minor gaps in error scenario specifications and security test requirements."
