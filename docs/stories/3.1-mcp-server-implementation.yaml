      Story 3.1 "MCP Server Implementation" is the foundational infrastructure story for enabling Claude AI to communicate with the service. This story establishes the core MCP protocol handler that will serve as the foundation for all future Claude-service interactions. The implementation focuses on creating a robust HTTP+SSE-based MCP server (Streamable HTTP per MCP specification) that handles protocol-compliant message exchange, session lifecycle, and concurrent operations. The story requires implementing 6 core acceptance criteria: HTTP+SSE server implementation, HTTP endpoint for MCP, message parsing/validation, response formatting, session management, and concurrent session support. This is a pure infrastructure story with no UI components - all functionality is exposed via protocol endpoints. The implementation follows the Mark3Labs MCP-Go library approach for type-safe protocol compliance and must be fully automatable for CI/CD deployment. The generated tasks reveal a comprehensive implementation strategy covering HTTP+SSE infrastructure, HTTP endpoints, message parsing, response formatting, session management, concurrent support, E2E testing, and deployment configuration. Each task is structured with clear subtasks that reference specific architecture components, coding standards, and technology stack requirements.

  assessment:
    summary: "Story 3.1 demonstrates excellent implementation readiness with comprehensive technical specifications, clear acceptance criteria, and well-structured tasks. The story covers all essential aspects of MCP server implementation including WebSocket infrastructure, protocol compliance, connection management, and concurrent operations. Task breakdown is thorough with specific file paths, library references, and architectural alignments. However, there are opportunities to strengthen error handling scenarios, security validation, and deployment verification procedures."

    strengths:
      - "Comprehensive task breakdown with 9 detailed tasks covering infrastructure, protocol implementation, testing, and deployment"
      - "Clear acceptance criteria mapping - each task explicitly references AC-1 through AC-6 ensuring full coverage"
      - "Strong architectural alignment - tasks reference specific architecture docs, coding standards, and tech stack requirements"
      - "Excellent testing strategy - includes unit tests (85% coverage target), integration tests, load tests, stress tests, and E2E tests"
      - "Well-defined technology stack - Mark3Labs MCP-Go library, Go stdlib net/http with SSE, Fiber framework, zerolog logging"
      - "Comprehensive configuration management - 8 environment variables defined with defaults and descriptions"
      - "Clear file structure - 14 specific files identified with descriptions and responsibilities"
      - "Performance requirements specified - connection limits, timeouts, message processing latency targets"
      - "Deployment strategy included - Docker, Railway configuration, CI/CD integration across 3 environments"
      - "Connection lifecycle management detailed - connect, heartbeat, timeout, cleanup, concurrent operations"

    improvements:
      - "Add explicit security validation subtasks - authentication/authorization mechanisms, token validation, origin verification beyond CORS"
      - "Include protocol version compatibility handling - specify behavior when client/server protocol versions mismatch"
      - "Define error recovery scenarios - specify retry logic for transient failures, backoff strategies, circuit breaker thresholds"
      - "Add monitoring and observability subtasks - metrics collection, distributed tracing, alerting thresholds, dashboard requirements"
      - "Specify connection storm mitigation - define rate limiting thresholds, backpressure mechanisms, graceful degradation strategies"
      - "Include upgrade/migration path - specify how to handle protocol upgrades, backward compatibility, versioning strategy"
      - "Define data retention policies - connection logs, message audit trails, performance metrics retention periods"
      - "Add production readiness checklist - runbook creation, incident response procedures, rollback strategy"
      - "Specify integration validation - how to verify Mark3Labs MCP-Go library compatibility, schema validation against official MCP spec"
      - "Include performance baseline establishment - specify how to measure and validate the '<100ms message processing' requirement"

    risk_level: "Medium"
    risk_reason: "While the story is well-structured with comprehensive tasks, Medium risk stems from: (1) External dependency on Mark3Labs MCP-Go library - potential version compatibility or schema mismatch issues, (2) Concurrent session management complexity - race conditions, deadlocks, resource exhaustion in high-load scenarios, (3) HTTP+SSE protocol implementation nuances - SSE stream stability, session tracking, message delivery guarantees, (4) First-of-its-kind implementation - no existing service baseline for MCP protocol in the codebase, (5) Multi-environment deployment coordination - Railway configuration across dev/staging/prod with proper domain routing. These risks are manageable with thorough testing and incremental rollout but require careful implementation attention."
    testability_score: 9
    testability_max: 10
    testability_notes: "Excellent testability with comprehensive test coverage across multiple levels: (1) Unit tests specified for HTTP+SSE handler, parser, formatter components with 85% coverage target, (2) Integration tests using Playwright Request API for endpoint validation, (3) Load tests for 50+ concurrent sessions, (4) Stress tests for session churn and rapid cycles, (5) E2E tests covering all 6 acceptance criteria with specific scenarios, (6) Test fixtures defined for reusable MCP message data. Clear AAA pattern requirement and scenario ID system enforcement. The only minor gap is lack of explicit chaos engineering or failure injection tests for extreme edge cases (e.g., Redis connection loss during high load, graceful degradation scenarios). Performance validation approach for '<100ms message processing' needs specific measurement methodology."
