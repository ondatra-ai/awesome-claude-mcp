      insights:
          - Core implementation focus on WebSocket and HTTP endpoints for MCP protocol
          - Requires message parsing, validation, and response formatting
          - Must handle concurrent connections and connection lifecycle
          - Critical security considerations for WebSocket server
          - Testing emphasis on E2E protocol compliance

  assessment:
    summary: "Well-structured MCP server implementation story with clear acceptance criteria, comprehensive tasks, and detailed technical specifications. Strong test coverage planned across all layers."

    strengths:
      - "Detailed task breakdown with clear mapping to acceptance criteria"
      - "Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, E2E) planned for each component"
      - "Clear technical specifications and dependencies documented"
      - "Strong focus on error handling and edge cases"
      - "Performance requirements clearly defined with measurable metrics"

    improvements:
      - "Add specific security testing requirements beyond basic validation"
      - "Include load testing success criteria for concurrent connections"
      - "Specify monitoring requirements for production deployment"
      - "Define rollback procedures for connection management failures"

    risk_level: "Medium"
    risk_reason: "Complex concurrent connection handling and WebSocket state management require careful implementation and testing. Production monitoring gaps identified."
    testability_score: 9
    testability_max: 10
    testability_notes: "Excellent testability with clear test points at all layers. E2E testing framework and load testing specifically called out. Minor gap in security testing specification."
