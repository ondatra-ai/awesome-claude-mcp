# Project Brief: MCP Google Docs Editor

## Executive Summary

The MCP Google Docs Editor is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Claude AI to directly edit Google Docs through natural language commands. This tool bridges the gap between AI assistants and document collaboration platforms, allowing organizations to leverage AI for document editing workflows while maintaining security through OAuth authentication. The primary value proposition is seamless integration of AI capabilities into existing Google Workspace document workflows, enabling both individual users and teams to automate document creation, editing, and formatting tasks through Claude's web and desktop interfaces.

## Problem Statement

Currently, users who want to leverage Claude AI for document editing must manually copy and paste content between Claude and Google Docs, creating a fragmented and inefficient workflow. This manual process:

- Introduces friction that reduces productivity gains from AI assistance
- Increases risk of errors during content transfer
- Makes it difficult to maintain formatting consistency
- Prevents real-time collaboration between AI and document editing
- Limits the ability to automate document-based workflows

Existing solutions either require complex API integrations, lack proper authentication for organizational use, or don't support the flexibility needed for various editing operations (insert, replace, append). The urgency is driven by increasing adoption of AI tools in enterprise environments where document collaboration is critical, and organizations need secure, scalable solutions that integrate with their existing Google Workspace infrastructure.

## Proposed Solution

The MCP Google Docs Editor provides a secure, OAuth-protected service that acts as an intermediary between Claude AI and Google Docs API. The solution:

- Accepts Markdown content from Claude and converts it to properly formatted Google Docs content
- Supports multiple editing modes (replace, insert, append) with regex-based anchor targeting
- Maintains document formatting integrity including headings, tables, images, and links
- Provides structured JSON responses that enable Claude to handle errors intelligently
- Operates as a shared service accessible to any organization while maintaining individual user authentication

This solution succeeds where others haven't by focusing on simplicity (no UI required), security (OAuth per-user authentication), and flexibility (multiple editing modes with pattern matching).

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Enterprise Knowledge Workers

- **Profile:** Professionals in medium to large organizations using Google Workspace
- **Current Workflow:** Manually transferring AI-generated content to collaborative documents
- **Pain Points:** Time-consuming copy-paste operations, formatting inconsistencies, inability to automate document updates
- **Goals:** Streamline document creation, maintain consistent formatting, reduce manual effort in document management

### Secondary User Segment: Individual Power Users

- **Profile:** Freelancers, consultants, and individual contributors who heavily use AI tools
- **Current Workflow:** Using Claude for content generation but manually managing documents
- **Pain Points:** Workflow interruption when switching between tools, loss of context when transferring content
- **Goals:** Create seamless AI-powered document workflows, maintain document version control

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives
- Enable 100+ organizations to adopt the tool within 6 months
- Reduce document editing time by 50% for repetitive tasks
- Achieve 95% uptime for service availability
- Support 10,000+ document edits per month at scale

### User Success Metrics
- Time from Claude command to document update < 5 seconds
- Zero authentication failures after initial OAuth setup
- 90% success rate for anchor-based replacements
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **API Response Time:** Average < 2 seconds per operation
- **Authentication Success Rate:** > 99% after initial setup
- **Error Recovery Rate:** 80% of errors provide actionable hints
- **Format Preservation:** 100% accuracy in Markdown to Google Docs conversion

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
- **OAuth Authentication:** Secure Google account integration with one-time setup
- **Document Editing:** Support for replace_all, append, prepend operations
- **Anchor-Based Editing:** Regex pattern matching for replace_match, insert_before, insert_after
- **Markdown Processing:** Convert Markdown to Google Docs formatting (headings, lists, links)
- **Error Handling:** Structured JSON responses with actionable hints for recovery
- **Image Support:** Insert images from external URLs
- **Table Support:** Convert Markdown tables to Google Docs tables

### Out of Scope for MVP
- Document creation (only editing existing documents)
- Comments and suggestions mode
- Local image uploads
- Document search/discovery functionality
- Batch operations on multiple documents
- Format preservation when reading documents
- Version control or rollback features
- Custom authentication methods beyond OAuth

### MVP Success Criteria
The MVP is successful when users can reliably edit Google Docs through Claude with all supported Markdown formatting preserved, errors are handled gracefully with actionable feedback, and the service maintains consistent availability for authenticated users.

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features
- Document creation capabilities with folder selection
- Batch operations for multiple document updates
- Template system for common document structures
- Read operations to fetch document content
- Support for Google Sheets basic operations

### Long-term Vision
Within 1-2 years, evolve into a comprehensive Google Workspace MCP suite supporting Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drive operations, enabling complex document workflows and automation scenarios through Claude AI.

### Expansion Opportunities
- Integration with other MCP tools for comprehensive workflows
- Custom formatting rules and style guides
- Organizational admin controls and audit logging
- Support for Google Workspace add-ons and scripts

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements
- **Target Platforms:** Claude web interface (primary), Claude desktop app
- **Browser/OS Support:** Any modern browser with Google OAuth support
- **Performance Requirements:** < 2 second response time, support for documents up to 100MB

### Technology Preferences
- **Frontend:** No UI required (MCP protocol only)
- **Backend:** Node.js or Python for MCP server implementation
- **Database:** Optional Redis for OAuth token caching
- **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Cloud-hosted service (AWS/GCP/Azure) with auto-scaling

### Architecture Considerations
- **Repository Structure:** Single repository with MCP server implementation
- **Service Architecture:** Stateless microservice with OAuth token management
- **Integration Requirements:** Google Docs API v1, MCP protocol compliance
- **Security/Compliance:** OAuth 2.0, HTTPS only, no credential storage, token refresh handling

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Budget:** Minimal - primarily API costs and hosting
- **Timeline:** MVP delivery within 4-6 weeks
- **Resources:** 1-2 developers familiar with MCP and Google APIs
- **Technical:** Google API rate limits, MCP protocol limitations

### Key Assumptions
- Google Docs API remains stable and accessible
- Users have appropriate permissions for documents they attempt to edit
- External image URLs remain accessible during insertion
- Organizations allow OAuth connections to third-party services
- MCP protocol continues to be supported by Claude

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
- **API Rate Limiting:** Google may throttle requests during high usage periods
- **OAuth Token Expiry:** Token refresh failures could interrupt service
- **Formatting Complexity:** Edge cases in Markdown to Google Docs conversion
- **Security Concerns:** Organizations may restrict OAuth access

### Open Questions
- How to handle collaborative editing conflicts?
- Should we cache document structure for better anchor matching?
- What's the optimal retry strategy for API failures?
- How to handle very large documents efficiently?

### Areas Needing Further Research
- Google Docs API limitations for complex formatting
- MCP protocol best practices for error handling
- OAuth token management at scale
- Performance optimization for large Markdown inputs
