  - Then: All links are valid and accessible

#### AC6: MIT license file added

**Coverage: NONE**

Given-When-Then Mappings:
- **No existing tests found**

**Required Test Coverage:**
- **Validation Test**: `tests/setup/license_test.go::TestLicenseFile`
  - Given: Project repository
  - When: License validation checks run
  - Then: LICENSE file exists, contains MIT text, and has correct year (2025)

- **Content Test**: `tests/setup/license_test.go::TestLicenseContent`
  - Given: LICENSE file
  - When: Content parsing and validation occurs
  - Then: License text matches standard MIT template with correct project name

### Critical Gaps

1. **Infrastructure Setup Validation**
   - Gap: No automated validation of project structure setup
   - Risk: High - Incorrect setup could break entire development workflow
   - Action: Implement comprehensive setup validation tests

2. **Build System Testing**
   - Gap: Makefile targets not tested for functionality
   - Risk: High - Broken build targets could block development
   - Action: Add integration tests for all Makefile targets

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Gap: No validation that specified dependencies work together
   - Risk: Medium - Dependency conflicts could cause runtime issues
   - Action: Add dependency resolution and compatibility tests

4. **Documentation Quality**
   - Gap: No validation that setup instructions actually work
   - Risk: Medium - Poor documentation leads to developer friction
   - Action: Add automated testing of setup instructions

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Setup Integration Tests**
   - Test complete project initialization from scratch
   - Validate each Makefile target works correctly
   - Test directory structure matches architecture specification
   - Test all dependencies install and resolve correctly

2. **Documentation Tests**
   - Parse and validate README.md structure and content
   - Test that setup instructions are complete and accurate
   - Validate all links and references work

3. **Configuration Validation**
   - Test .gitignore patterns work correctly
   - Validate Go module configuration
   - Test license file content and format

4. **Automated Setup Scripts**
   - Create setup validation scripts that can be run in CI/CD
   - Test setup process in clean environments (Docker containers)
   - Validate setup works on different operating systems

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: AC1, AC2, AC3 - No coverage for core infrastructure setup
- **Medium Risk**: AC4 - Partial coverage for git configuration  
- **Medium Risk**: AC5, AC6 - No coverage for documentation and licensing

### Test Data Requirements

- Clean directory structures for testing
- Sample dependency configurations
- Mock environment variables for testing
- Test artifacts for validation scripts

### Mock/Stub Strategies

- Mock file system operations for unit tests
- Use temporary directories for integration tests
- Mock external dependencies (Docker, AWS CLI) for isolated testing
- Stub network calls for dependency resolution tests

### Testability Assessment

**Controllability: MEDIUM**
- Can control directory creation and file generation
- Can control environment variables and configurations
- Limited control over external dependencies

**Observability: HIGH**
- Easy to observe file system changes
- Can validate file contents and structure
- Clear success/failure criteria for each component

**Debuggability: HIGH**  
- File-based operations are easy to inspect
- Configuration errors have clear symptoms
- Build failures provide detailed error messages

### Infrastructure Testing Strategy

Since this is a repository setup story, testing should focus on:

1. **Setup Script Tests**: Validate that setup scripts create correct structure
2. **Build Validation**: Test that generated build configuration works
3. **Environment Tests**: Test setup in clean environments
4. **Documentation Tests**: Validate setup instructions are correct
5. **Regression Tests**: Ensure setup doesn't break existing functionality

### Automation Recommendations

1. Create setup validation scripts that can be run in CI/CD
2. Use Docker containers for clean environment testing  
3. Implement pre-commit hooks to validate project structure
4. Add GitHub Actions workflow to test setup process

### Dependencies for Testing

- Docker for clean environment testing
- Go toolchain for build validation
- Node.js for frontend setup validation
- Git for repository validation
- Make for build system testing
