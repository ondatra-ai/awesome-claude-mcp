Author: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Acceptance Criteria → Test Mapping

| Acceptance Criterion | Test ID(s) | Notes |
|----------------------|------------|-------|
| Railway project linked and CLI authenticated | RLY-001, RLY-002 | `railway link --project 801ad5e0-95bf-4ce6-977e-6f2fa37529fd` succeeds before deploy |
| Development, Staging, Production environments created | RLY-001, RLY-004 | `railway status --json` lists all environments |
| Services created for each environment | RLY-001, RLY-004 | CLI deploys target the expected service names (`frontend-dev`, `backend-staging`, etc.) |
| Environment variables configured per service | RLY-007 | `railway variables --service <name>` returns correct API URLs and ports |
| Custom domains mapped and verified | RLY-005, RLY-006 | DNS + HTTPS checks for `dev.ondatra-ai.xyz`, `api.dev.ondatra-ai.xyz` |
| GitHub Actions workflow deploys successfully | RLY-003, RLY-004 | Workflow run logs show successful status per environment |

## Test Evidence Checklist
- ✅ Railway CLI deploy logs saved (development + staging)
- ✅ GitHub Actions run IDs recorded for manual dispatch and branch-triggered deploys
- ✅ DNS verification screenshots or CLI output stored in QA evidence folder
- ✅ `curl` output for `/health` endpoints captured and archived

## Observations / Follow-ups
- Staging/Production custom domains pending DNS delegation
- Consider adding automated smoke tests post-deploy
- Evaluate Railway add-ons (Redis, Postgres) once persistence stories begin
