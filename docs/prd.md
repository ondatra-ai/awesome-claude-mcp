# MCP Google Docs Editor Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable seamless editing of Google Docs directly through Claude AI without manual copy-paste operations
- Support all six essential document editing operations (replace_all, append, prepend, replace_match, insert_before, insert_after) with complete Markdown formatting
- Achieve 99% operation success rate with 100+ daily edits across 30 daily active users
- Demonstrate team capabilities in MCP/AI integration as foundation for broader Google Workspace suite
- Establish foundation for sustainable revenue model through freemium subscription service
- Position product for market expansion with advanced features beyond MVP

### Background Context

The MCP Google Docs Editor addresses the critical workflow fragmentation experienced by AI users who currently must manually transfer content between Claude and Google Docs. This manual process introduces errors, breaks formatting consistency, and prevents automation of document-based workflows. By creating a secure, OAuth-protected MCP server that acts as an intelligent bridge between Claude AI and Google Docs API, we enable organizations to leverage AI for document editing while maintaining their existing security and collaboration infrastructure.

This project serves as the initial beachhead for a comprehensive Google Workspace MCP suite, demonstrating our technical capabilities while solving an immediate, high-value problem for enterprise knowledge workers and power users who rely on both AI assistance and collaborative document editing.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

All services, including the Frontend Service (Next.js), Backend Service (Go Fiber), MCP Service (Mark3Labs MCP-Go), and any future components will be maintained in a single monorepo structure to simplify development and deployment for the single developer team.

### Service Architecture

The system will be implemented as Dockerized services deployed to Railway environments. Railway manages container orchestration, TLS, and custom domains for Development, Staging, and Production. The architecture includes Frontend Service (Next.js), Backend Service (Go Fiber with MCP tooling), and optional future services following the design patterns established in the architecture document.

### Testing Requirements

Comprehensive testing pyramid including:
- Unit tests for all business logic (minimum 80% coverage)
- Integration tests for external API interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- All tests must pass before any deployment
- Test implementation required for every user story

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Backend Services:** Go 1.21.5 with Fiber framework for Backend and MCP services
- **Frontend Service:** TypeScript with Next.js 14 (App Router) and modern React patterns
- **MCP Protocol:** Mark3Labs MCP-Go library for MCP protocol implementation
- Railway as the hosting platform (Docker deploys, managed TLS, custom domains)
- Redis cache (Railway add-on or external provider) for token/session storage
- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds for all services
- Application logging emitted as structured JSON and inspected via Railway logs
- Standard MCP protocol implementation without extensions
- OAuth tokens cached until expiry by default
- No access controls or rate limiting in MVP (add in v2)
- Fail-fast error handling - no automatic retries
- All configuration via environment variables managed in Railway
- GitHub Actions + Railway CLI for CI/CD (`deploy_to_railway.yml`)
- Markdown parsing using goldmark library
- Structured JSON logging for all operations

## User Roles

The MCP Google Docs Editor serves two distinct user personas, each with specific needs and interaction patterns:

### Claude User

**Definition:** An individual who uses Claude Desktop or Claude Web App and wants to edit their Google Docs through natural language commands.

**Primary Use Case:** Document editing through conversational AI interface

**User Journey:**
1. Register on the MCP server and complete OAuth authentication with Google
2. Write natural language commands to Claude (e.g., "Hey Claude, update document named TEST with text NEW TEXT")
3. View changes reflected in their Google Documents
4. Continue iterating on document content through Claude conversations

**Key Characteristics:**
- Non-technical users focused on content creation and editing
- Values seamless integration between Claude AI and Google Docs
- Expects reliable, fast document operations with clear error messaging
- May manage multiple Google accounts for different organizations/projects

### Developer/Maintainer

**Definition:** Technical personnel responsible for building, deploying, monitoring, and maintaining the MCP Google Docs Editor system.

**Primary Use Case:** System development, deployment, and operational support

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Infrastructure setup and configuration (Railway environments, OAuth, monitoring)
- Code development and testing for MCP server functionality
- System monitoring, debugging, and performance optimization
- Security management and token handling
- CI/CD pipeline management and deployment processes

- Technical expertise in Go, Railway CLI, MCP protocol, and Google APIs
- Focused on system reliability, security, and performance
- Responsible for maintaining 99% uptime and handling technical issues
- Supports Claude Users through system stability and feature development

### Role Usage in User Stories

Throughout this PRD, all user stories use one of these two roles:
- **"As a Claude User"** - Features and functionality that directly serve end-users
- **"As a Developer/Maintainer"** - Technical implementation and operational requirements

This role distinction ensures clear separation between user-facing features and technical infrastructure needs.
