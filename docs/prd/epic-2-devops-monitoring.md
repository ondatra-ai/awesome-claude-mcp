# Epic 2: DevOps & Monitoring Infrastructure

**Status:** PLANNED
**Goal:** Establish comprehensive monitoring, observability, and development tooling for operational excellence

**Context:** Following Epic 1's successful foundation deployment, Epic 2 focuses on operational concerns including monitoring, alerting, performance tracking, and development quality gates.

## User Stories

### Story 2.1: Application Monitoring Setup
**As a** Developer/Maintainer
**I want** comprehensive monitoring and alerting
**So that** I can track system health, performance, and proactively address issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Application logs accessible via Railway dashboard for each environment
- Health checks exposed on backend services (`/health`) and validated by Railway
- Third-party monitoring integration (Better Stack, Sentry, or equivalent)
- Alerts established for service downtime using Railway notifications or external tooling
- Basic dashboard/reporting for Railway metrics and custom metrics
- Performance metrics collection (response times, throughput, error rates)
- Uptime monitoring for all custom domains (`dev.ondatra-ai.xyz`, `api.dev.ondatra-ai.xyz`, etc.)

### Story 2.2: Test Coverage Reporting & Quality Gates
**As a** Developer/Maintainer
**I want** comprehensive test coverage reporting and quality gates
**So that** I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Test coverage reporting enabled for all services (Jest for frontend, Go coverage for backend)
- Coverage thresholds enforced in CI/CD pipeline (minimum 80% line coverage)
- Coverage reports published to GitHub PR comments
- Quality gates prevent merging below coverage thresholds
- Code coverage badges in README files
- Integration with existing pre-commit hooks for coverage validation
- Coverage trend tracking over time

### Story 2.3: Logging & Alerting Infrastructure
**As a** Developer/Maintainer
**I want** centralized logging and intelligent alerting
**So that** I can quickly diagnose issues and maintain system reliability

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Structured JSON logging implemented across all services
- Log aggregation and searchability (Railway logs or external service)
- Error tracking and grouping (Sentry or equivalent)
- Alert channels configured (Slack, email, or preferred notification system)
- Log retention policies defined and implemented
- Application performance monitoring (APM) for request tracing
- Security event logging and monitoring

### Story 2.4: Performance Monitoring & Metrics
**As a** Developer/Maintainer
**I want** detailed performance monitoring and custom metrics
**So that** I can optimize system performance and track business metrics

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Application metrics dashboard (response times, throughput, error rates)
- Database performance monitoring (if applicable)
- Frontend performance monitoring (Core Web Vitals, load times)
- Custom business metrics tracking (API usage, feature adoption)
- Performance regression detection in CI/CD
- Resource utilization monitoring (CPU, memory, disk usage)
- Automated performance testing and benchmarking

## Dependencies
- **Epic 1**: Foundation & Infrastructure (âœ… COMPLETE) - Required for deployment targets
- **Railway Infrastructure**: Existing Railway environments and services
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Existing GitHub Actions workflow

## Priority Considerations
This epic can be prioritized alongside feature development epics. Consider business priorities:
- **High Priority**: If operational visibility is critical for production readiness
- **Medium Priority**: If feature development (OAuth, Google Docs integration) takes precedence
- **Incremental**: Stories can be implemented individually as operational needs arise

## Success Criteria
- Zero-downtime deployments with full observability
- Sub-5-minute mean time to detection (MTTD) for critical issues
- Comprehensive test coverage maintained above quality thresholds
- Performance baseline established with regression detection
- Operational runbooks documented with monitoring integration

## Technical Notes
- Leverage Railway's built-in monitoring where possible
- Consider cost implications of external monitoring services
- Ensure monitoring doesn't impact application performance
- Design for multi-environment monitoring (dev/staging/prod)
- Plan for monitoring data retention and compliance requirements
