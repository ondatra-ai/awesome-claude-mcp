# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable seamless editing of Google Docs directly through Claude AI without manual copy-paste operations
- Support all six essential document editing operations (replace_all, append, prepend, replace_match, insert_before, insert_after) with complete Markdown formatting
- Achieve 99% operation success rate with 100+ daily edits across 30 daily active users
- Demonstrate team capabilities in MCP/AI integration as foundation for broader Google Workspace suite
- Establish foundation for sustainable revenue model through freemium subscription service
- Position product for market expansion with advanced features beyond MVP

## Background Context

The MCP Google Docs Editor addresses the critical workflow fragmentation experienced by AI users who currently must manually transfer content between Claude and Google Docs. This manual process introduces errors, breaks formatting consistency, and prevents automation of document-based workflows. By creating a secure, OAuth-protected MCP server that acts as an intelligent bridge between Claude AI and Google Docs API, we enable organizations to leverage AI for document editing while maintaining their existing security and collaboration infrastructure.

This project serves as the initial beachhead for a comprehensive Google Workspace MCP suite, demonstrating our technical capabilities while solving an immediate, high-value problem for enterprise knowledge workers and power users who rely on both AI assistance and collaborative document editing.
